# Group axioms

The set of its symmetries forms an algebraic object, meaning that there is a kind of “multiplication”: Given two symmetries.

$S$ and $T$, their product $ST$ is the transformation you get by applying $T$ first, and then.
$S$. This corresponds to taking the composition of the transformations $S$ and $T$.
Let’s look at some of the properties these algebraic systems always have, and we’ll use these properties to motivate our definition of a group.

## Identity

Every collection of symmetries has the identity symmetry $I$, given by the function $f(x)=x$, that “does nothing.” So what happens when you multiply $I$ by the other symmetries?

## Inverses

Because the underlying functions are all [bijections](../terms/bijection.md), they all have inverses. Intuitively, this means that given any symmetry $S$ of a shape, there is a symmetry, called the inverse of ,
$S$, that “undoes” $S$.

For example, with the equilateral triangle, if $S$ is clockwise rotation by 120&deg;, then the inverse of $S$ is counterclockwise rotation by 120&deg; . Suppose $T$ is a reflection symmetry of the equilateral triangle.

## Commutativity

One nice property that some algebraic systems have is commutativity. This means that when you perform the operation, the order of the two arguments doesn’t matter.

For example, for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$, $x∗y=y∗x$. Real number multiplication is commutative, and real number addition is also commutative.

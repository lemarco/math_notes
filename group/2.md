In fact, we can combine any two symmetries of a shape by doing one after the other, and obtain a third symmetry of the shape. We express this with the following notation: If A and B are symmetries of a shape, $A*B$, or sometimes just $AB$ or , $A∘B$, denotes the symmetry you get by applying $B$ first, and then $A$. We will call this new symmetry theproduct of $A$ and $B$.
if we let $\phi_1 $ denote the reflection about AF , let $\phi_2$ denote the reflectrion $CE$ and let $R$ denote clockwise rotation by 120&deg; then we can write equation $\phi_2*\phi_1 = R$

To really understand the symmetries of an object, we should know not only how many symmetries there are, but what the rules are for how they combine with each other.
For the equilateral triangle, we could make a 6x6 “multiplication table” that tells you, for any two of the six symmetries of the triangle, what their product is. In the next problems, we will do exactly that for a slightly simpler object.

The letter I has four symmetries:

* A horizontal reflection (flipping across the blue line) $H$
* A vertical reflection (flipping across the red line) $V$
* A rotation by 180&deg; $R$ 
* The identity transformation $I$
